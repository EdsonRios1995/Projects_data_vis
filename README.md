This folder contains some of the projects I have worked with for academic purposes and as a hobby.

-HousingPrices and mammographic are some projects I worked as a hobby, they include some data visualization.
-Coulomb scattering and SemiconductorPL are projects I worked with during university.
-Physical_processes_sim are simulations of physical phenomena, they were useful in getting numerical approaches and 
bringing some visualization of the phenomena.
